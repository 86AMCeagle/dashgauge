# dashgauge I'm working on a graphic display of automotive gauges IE fuel, temp, oil pressure, RPM, The graphics are going to be the hardest part for me. The last time i did any real graphics if you can call it that was in BASIC (on a Sinclair 44.) My plan is to have an anolog style sweeping needle with a digital reading at the needles base. As an example An oil pressure gauge would display the actual PSI digitally with the needle being in the respective range of the pressure, I would also like to change the color of the particular gauge display if it falls out of a predetermind range, so if the pressure would drop below a certain set pressure then the gauge would turn red. The vehicle this would go into is not a computer car so all of the data will come from anolog sensors (resistive) and not read from an OBDII or CAN port.
